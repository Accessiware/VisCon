## What is VisCon?

VisCon is at its core, a word processing program. The difference between VisCon and other word processing programs is that VisCon uses a markup language to format your documents, which may sound a little advanced, but it is quite easy to learn in a short time, and there are several benefits  taking advantage of this Model

You can always get VisCon to create a document that suits another program. For example, if you want to send your document to someone who prefers to use Microsoft Word, VisCon ensures that the document is converted to a regular Word document that can be opened in any newer version of Microsoft Word. VisCon supports Microsoft Word 2007 or later editions. All you have to do is save your document as a Word document, then VisCon will handle the rest of the work for you. In the chapter ["Working with documents"](#working-with-documents), you will find detailed information on how to work with documents in VisCon. However, VisCon does most of the conversion by itself so in most cases you will never have to think about converting your documents.

Conversely, you can also open a Word document in VisCon, which will itself convert it to the markup language so that you can make changes or save a copy before making any changes to the document.

## Why learn a markup language?

VisCon is built around the Markdown markup language. Markdown is a simple way to format text. Markdown was originally invented because one would like to have a simpler way to format Web pages. Over time, however, many others have also found that Markdown could be used for other cases than websites, which VisCon is an excellent example of. With VisCon you can both get web content done, but you can also use it for formatting purposes. So be creative and try all the use cases you can think of with VisCon. And please share your experiences with us and other users.

All of this documentation has been prepared in Markdown in VisCon. In Appendix 1 you will find a general introduction to Markdown and useful external resources which may help you learn the basics of Markdown.

To illustrate how simple this markdown markup language is, see the following example.

Here we have an ordered list with three  items.

First you will see how the list should be written. Then you see the result.

~~~
To write a list:

1. Here is the first list item.
2. Here is the second list item.
3. Here is the third list item.
~~~

The result looks like this:

To write a list:

1. Here is the first list item.
2. Here is the second list item.
3. Here is the third list item.

As you see above, the markup of the list items is very simple and similar to what most would even write when an ordered list is wanted. In other word processing applications, these will even guess when you want to make a list like the one you see in the example above. Often, you don't have to be aware of when you write content in your document, or when you edit the formatting and layout of your document.

One advantage is that you can work on your document from any device you may have access to. The only requirement VisCon asks is that the document is saved as plain text or Markdown. It can be done from virtually any computer, mobile phone or tablet.
So you are sure that the document you are working on can be opened and edited no matter what device you are working from.

Another advantage of using VisCon is that you gain full control over the layout and structure of your document. No unwanted surprises while composing and editing your documents. At the moment you cannot define fonts inside VisCon, but you can structure and organise your documents.

We strongly recommend that you experiment with VisCon so that you can judge and evaluate the results with your own eyes. VisCon is one of the tools that can be very difficult to describe, but once you see it in practice, the understanding comes quite quickly.
