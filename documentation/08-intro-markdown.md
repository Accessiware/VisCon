# Appendix 1: An introduction to Markdown {#markdown-intro}

The purpose of Markdown is to make formatted documents easy to read. Markdown was invented by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Ever since it began back in 2004, Markdown has evolved extensively over the years. There are now multiple specifications of Markdown. Some of the more popular Markdown variants are MultiMarkdown, PHP Markdown Extra, Strict Markdown, and GitHub flavored Markdown. One thing all these variants have in common is that they are easy to read and write. You can, in fact, write in different flavors without harming your document.

Depending on your projects, there are no right or wrong way to start learning Markdown. However, we strongly recommend that if Markdown is brand new for you, it is best to start reading [Markdown, invented by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
On this site, you will find the philosophy behind Markdown and a general syntax guide.

Do not try to learn it all, but instead search for the format elements you want, and take it in small steps.

And best of all: Contact us or someone you may know who can assist you with Markdown if you need it.
